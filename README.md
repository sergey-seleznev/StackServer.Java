# StackServer.Java
The project is a Java solution for a backend software developer position at http://www.fob-solutions.com.  
During the interview the task was actually [implemented](https://github.com/sergey-seleznev/StackServer/) using the .NET Core platform.

# Task
Design and implement client-server integer data stack web application.  
Each user connected should work with its own private stack (so, sessions need to be introduced).
* Back-end: standard push, pop and view API operations.  
* Front-end: a simplistic yet functional web interface is preferred.
